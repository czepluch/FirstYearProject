In order for the application to be even more intuitive, two features when searching for locations or trips could be added.

The first one is allowing the user to press the "Find" button by hitting enter/return, meaning the the user does not have to move the cursor in order to execute a search.

The second one is allowing the user to select the addresses from the list of suggested address using the keyboard only (using the tab or arrow buttons).

These features would allow the user to execute searches without using the mouse whatsoever. And more important, it is something we have experience we do intuitively while using the application, which then causes us to be annoyed that the feature is missing. So even though it is not essential to the functionality of the application, we believe that it could by far improve the user experience of searching.
