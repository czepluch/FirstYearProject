Two simple features could be added to make the application more intuitive.

The first one is allowing the user to press the "Find" button by hitting enter/return, meaning the user does not have to move the cursor in order to execute a search.

The second one is allowing the user to select the addresses from the list of suggested addresses using the keyboard only (using the tab or arrow buttons).

These features would allow the user to execute searches without using the mouse whatsoever. And more importantly, it is something we have experienced that we try to do intuitively while using the application, which then causes us to be annoyed that the feature is missing. So even though it is not essential to the functionality of the application, we believe that it could significantly improve the user experience of searching.
