The fact that the application does not take into account one-way streets nor the fact that things as walking on the highway are illegal, can in some cases be quite a limitation to the path finding part of the program. As only a very small part of the Danish streets are one-way streets, this is only an issue in areas with these being more common. But the quality of the path finding is decreased a lot, as you risk being directed onto a small path for walking while driving your car.

This is a limitation we are aware of, and a limitation that should definitely be corrected, were the program to be used in real life applications.
