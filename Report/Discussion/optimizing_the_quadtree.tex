We thought about optimizing our quad trees such that when a sub tree is sufficiently small (say, contained a hundred elements) we would stop to further divide that sub tree and simply store all these elements in an \texttt{Array} or some similar data type that would do the job. The reason for this is that recursion is not all that fast in \texttt{Java} and we might be able to achieve a faster data structure this way.

We never got to implement and experiment with this, however, as we were on a tight schedule and as we, as mention, were satisfied with the performance as it currently is.
