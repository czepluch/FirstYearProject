We thought about optimizing our QuadTrees such that when a sub tree is sufficiently small (say, contained a hundred elements) we would seize to further divide that sub tree and simply let store all these elements in an \texttt{Array} or some similar data type that would do the job. The reason for this is that recursion is not all that fast in \texttt{Java} and we might be able to achieve a faster data structure this way.
