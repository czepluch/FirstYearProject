We have significant problems with character encoding. We agreed to use UTF-8 encoding, but had some trouble enforcing it across platforms. Especially, it was a while into the project that we realised our regular expressions in \texttt{AdressParser} class had been scrambled by Eclipse, because it defaults to Apple's MacRoman encoding on Mac OS, and UTF-8 on our linux systems. 
We finally reacted on it when the Mac users had to use $\surd$\P\ in place of '\o' in the search fields of the GUI. Now we all use UTF-8 when working in Eclipse. 

Even after this, we have still encountered some encoding problems while writing on the report.
