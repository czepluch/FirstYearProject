To make the map look a lot better and give a better idea of what part of the map the user is looking at, we would have liked to add some landscape and coastlines to the map. This did however not have a very high priority. 

To retrieve some data that we could possibly use to draw some landscape and coastlines, we wrote an email to krak.dk/eniro.dk and asked whether we could have the data files that they use for their own map. After a couple of emails back and forth, we were given the address to an ftp server from where we could download all the data that Krak themselves use for their map service. Unfortunately the data types were not of the same type that the types we use, and we did not have the time to make the new data type work with our own. Since it is not vital for our program, and the program still serves its purpose we did not add landscape.
