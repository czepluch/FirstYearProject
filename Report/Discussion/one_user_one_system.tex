Our program is limited to only have one user for each instance of the program. This is due to a couple of things. The main reason is that it never was part of out plan or design decisions to make a multiuser program. Further more would we have to make some quite big changes to out program to make it work with multiple users. Our pathfinding algorithm, is for example, very suitable and acceptable for a singleuser version of the program, but it would be too slow if we had around 100 or more users, because one search using Dijkstra's algorithm takes around 50 or 100 times longer than using the A* algorithm, which we would have to use instead if we were going to make a multiuser version of our program.
