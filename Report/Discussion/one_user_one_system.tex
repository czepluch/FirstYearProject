Our program is limited to only having one user for each instance of the program. This is due to a couple of things. The main reason is that it never was part of our plan or design decisions to make a multi-user program. Furthermore, we would have to make some big changes to the application in order to make it work with multiple users. Our path finding algorithm is, for example, very suitable and acceptable for a single-user version of the program, but it would be too slow if we had about 100 or more users, because one search using Dijkstra's algorithm takes around much longer than using the A* algorithm (causing a lot of waiting time for a lot of users), which we would have to use instead if we were going to make a multi-user version of our program.
