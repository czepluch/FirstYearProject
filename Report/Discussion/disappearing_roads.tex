We have been experiencing some disappearing roads while viewing the map at high zoom levels. This is due to the way our data structure is made. Fortunately, it is only very long edges that disappear at certain zoom levels. Since ferry routes are always displayed, the issue only exists with long segments of highway.

When a road disappears, it happens because none of the nodes of the edge are in the "viewbox" of the program. When we zoom in, we need to know which roads to draw in the frame. This is done by checking if the coordinates of an edge's nodes are within the "viewbox". If neither of the nodes are within the visible part of the map, the edge is not drawn. So naturally, when a very long edge should be drawn in the "viewbox", but does not have any of its nodes in the view, it is not drawn.
