We have been experiencing some disappearing roads while viewing the map at a zoom level where we see all road types. This is due to the way our data structure is made, and we did not discover this problem in time to change the data structure and fix the problem entirely. Fortunately it is only very long edges that disappear at certain zoom levels. The only edges that we have really experienced this problem with, are the ferry routes. We have however hardcoded the ferry routes always to be shown to avoid the problem.

When a road disappears it happens because none of the nodes of the edge are in the "viewbox" of the program. When we zoom in we need to know which roads to draw in the frame. This is done by checking if the coordinates of an edge's nodes are within the "viewbox" or its buffer zone. If neither of the nodes are withing the zone, the edge is not drawn. So naturally, when a very long edge should be drawn in the "viewbox", but does not have any of its nodes in the zone, it is not drawn.
