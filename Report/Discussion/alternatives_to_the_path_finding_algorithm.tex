Dijkstra's algorithm is not the fastest path finding algorithm, and this does show, when the paths get sufficiently long. Although it only takes about two seconds to find paths from one end of the map to another, this could very likely be improved by using another path finding algorithm such as the A* algorithm, which relies on heuristics to guess which direction to go in order to find a shortest path. We tried, unsuccessfully, to implemented, but working out a good heuristic for guessing the fastest path is not trivial. We ended up sticking with Dijkstra's algorithm simply because it worked fine and because we did not have a lot of time for extras.
