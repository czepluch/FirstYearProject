Dijkstra's algorithm is not the fastest path finding algorithm and this does show when the paths get sufficiently long. Although it only takes about two seconds to find paths from one end of the map to another, this could very likely be improved by using another path finding algorithm such as the A* algorithm, which relies on heuristics to guess which direction to go in order to find a shortest path. We had some trouble implementing it, though, and working out a good heuristic for guessing the fastest path is not trivial as it cannot simply use the Manhattan distance (as would be the case when searching for the shortest path).

The graph still has a few flaws. For example, some paths between two arbitrary points A and B will look just fine when going from A to B, but when going from B to A, the algorithm will a completely useless path. We have not been able to figure out what the cause of this is.
