We have decided on a quad tree for our data structure. We believe that we could have got a similar result using k-D trees. The k-D trees have the advantage that they are easy to balance. Quadtrees are simpler to implement than k-D tress, but given that we are satisfied with the performance of the quadtree, we have no reason to spend time implementing a more complicated data structure.
