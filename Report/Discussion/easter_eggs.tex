The easter eggs of the application as described in section \ref{sec:Imp, Easter eggs} og page \pageref{sec:Imp, Easter eggs} does not really add anything to the application itself from the user's point of view. However, we decided to include them anyway because the add a lot to the application from our point of view as the makers of the application.

More or less as soon as we had implemented the finding of trips, the implementation of the \textit{Rainbow Road} easter egg was implemented as well (actually this was through most of the writing of the application the default way of displaying roads with no other options available). And it is something we have actually had quite a lot of fun with. We find it unnecessary or at least sad to remove a, though small, part of the application which has been essential to the process of making the application. Instead we decided to hide it as an easter egg.

The \textit{Binary Input} easter egg has not, like the \textit{Rainbow Road}, been a part of application for a long time. The main reasons for having this hidden feature is that it is the only feature supported by our application, which is not supported by the major providers of map services.
