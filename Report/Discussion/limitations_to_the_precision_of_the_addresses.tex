The search for addresses in the application is, as mentioned in section \ref{sec:What is a valid address} on page \pageref{sec:What is a valid address}, limited in precision to the search for road names. This has both advantages and disadvantages.

When searching for an address, it is possible to make a much more stable parsing of the input from what the user types to a usable address if the address contains few parameters, because it is then limited in how many ways the user of the application can type a given address.

The automatic text completion is also of smaller size, given less parameters are contained in the address, since we store the same address in multiple formats in the trie. If more parameters were present, more formats would be needed. In fact, adding simply one parameter could cause the number of addresses to be stored in the trie to increase significantly (though that is not necessarily the result).

On the other hand, what the user can find on the map is, unless the user zooms and drags to the specific location and does not search for it, limited to the precision of the search. We do, however, believe that most of the roads in Denmark are not too long, and in most cases, finding a road would bring the user very close to the correct address. But in some cases where the user needs to find a very specific location in an area unknown to the user, finding the road would be of limited help in the task of finding the address.
