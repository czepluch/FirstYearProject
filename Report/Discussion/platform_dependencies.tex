We have experienced severe performance issues on different platforms. We first assumed it was OS dependent, which may still be case, but there seems to be some correlation to the Java runtime environment as well. One group member, running Arch Linux, experienced significant performance improvements by telling Eclipse to run the program in \texttt{openJDK7's JRE6}. At the same time another Arch Linux user had the opposite experience, i.e. the program ran better in \texttt{openJDK7's JRE7}.

The application is most thoroughly tested on computers running Mac OS 10.7 and the \texttt{JRE6} from Sun. It has not been tested on computers running Windows.
