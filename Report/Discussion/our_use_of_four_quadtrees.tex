Our current data structure consists of four quadtrees, one per type of edge stored. This means the application has to search through several quadtrees, if several types are to be drawn. It would be preferable having everything in the same tree, allowing the overall tree height (the sum of all our tree heights) to be smaller. But since we only have four quadtrees, we believe that the performance difference would be un-noticeable.
