Our current data structure consists of four quad trees, one per type of edge stored. This means that the application has to search through several quad trees if several types are to be drawn. It would be preferable to have everything in the same tree, allowing the overall tree height (the sum of all our tree heights) to be smaller. But since we only have four quad trees, we believe that the performance difference would be unnoticeable.
