To navigate the map, the user only has to use a regular mouse or touchpad with scroll functionallity.

To zoom in, you simly need to scroll either up or down, depending on, how your mouse or touchpad is configured. When zooming in, the zooming will happen relative to where the mouse pointer is located on the map. This means that if there is a certain area on the map that you want to zoom in on, you just need to place the cursor on that area.To zoom out, you need to scroll the opposite way than to zoom in. The more you zoom in, the more roads and details will you be able to see.

If the area you have zoomed in on, is not exactly the area you want to view, it is possible to navigate around the map by dragging up, down and to the sides, to find the area you want to view.
