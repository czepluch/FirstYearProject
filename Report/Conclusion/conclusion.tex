The application works as we want it to, and it passes the minimum requirements. It starts up a bit slow, but when it is up and running, it runs fast and smooth, at least on Mac OS X. There are additional features that we would have liked to implement but did not implement due to lack of time.

It is of our best conviction that the program is practical to use, though we do see possible improvements, and that the user finds it intuitive and quick to find the places and routes they want, even though we do not have any usability tests confirming this theory.

The thing that we are the least satisfied about is the relatively long start-up time. This is an area where we would use some time to make improvements, were we to work on future versions of the program.

Another downside to the application is its platform dependency. Though written entirely in Java, the program reacts very differently to user input on computers running Mac OS X and Arch Linux respectively. But due to the application only being used by us under controlled environments, this is not the issue it would be, were the application to be distributed.

If we were to continue working on the application, we would spend more time adding additional features for the sole purpose that we believe that we would learn a lot from doing so. We find no reason to add additional features unless they "give something back", and we are quite satisfied with the amount of learning we have received during the making of this project.

Technical issues have at some points been time consuming, but at no point have they been too critical for us to overcome them without too much difficulty.

The process of making the project has been an overall pleasant experience with no real discussions or issues not concerning the project itself. We have had a consistent structure of our group meetings that have worked for us, and even though we have not always discussed the work to be done sufficiently, causing different modules to need refactoring in order to fit together, the issues have been rare and minor.

The product itself, and our satisfaction with it, reflects the positive and stable process that we feel our group work has been.
