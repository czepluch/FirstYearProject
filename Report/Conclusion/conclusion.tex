******** Fill in a nice start to the conclusion ***********

Our program works like we want it to do. It starts up a bit slow, but when it is up and running it runs fast and smooth, atleast on Mac OS X.
The program has a couple of bugs that we are aware of, but have not fixed because we did not have the time for it. There is aswell some additional features that we would have liked to implement, but did not implement due to the lack of time. 

It is of our best conviction that the program is practical to use, and that the user finds it intuitive and quick to find the places and routes they want. 

The thing that we are the least satisfied about, is the relatively long period of time, the porgram uses to start up. The startup time is an area where we would use some time to make improvements in a future version of the program. 
******** find out if anything else could have been done differently or better ********

Furthermore, would we in a future version of the program, implement some of the features that we planned to do from the beginning, but did not have the time to do. A route description for each trip, was one of the things that we prioritized highly on out list of additions, but did not have the time for, so this would be included if we were to make a future version of the program. 
The drawing of landscape was also prioritized very highly on out list of additions. We looked a bit into the drawing of landscape, but stopped looking at it again to make sure we would finish the demanded functionalities of the program in time to test them, and improve them, if needed.
