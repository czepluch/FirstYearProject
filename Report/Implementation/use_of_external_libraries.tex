The application makes use of the external package MigLayout (\texttt{net.miginfocom.swing.MigLayout}, \url{http://www.miglayout.com/}) for laying out the \texttt{javax.swing} components of the \texttt{SearchPanel} class. The library allows arranging the components relative to each other using a lot less code than would be necessary using the layout managers of the \texttt{java.awt} library.
