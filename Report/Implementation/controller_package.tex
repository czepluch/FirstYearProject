The \texttt{Controller} package consists of the \texttt{Controller} class, which is both the main class (it has the main method, to be run when the application starts), and it is the link between the \texttt{Model} and \texttt{View} packages handling the flow of data between the two, and the \texttt{ErrorHandler} class for creating warning messages. When a change is made by the user, the \texttt{View} calls a method in the \texttt{Controller}, once again updating the graphical user interface according to user input and the data stored in the \texttt{Model} (as illustrated using a concrete example in figure \ref{fig:ControlFlow} on page \pageref{fig:ControlFlow}).
