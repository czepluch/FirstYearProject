The \texttt{Controller} package consists solely of the \texttt{Controller} class, which is both the main class (it has the main method, to be run when the application starts), and it is the link between the \texttt{Model} and \texttt{View} packages handling the flow of data between the two. When a change is made by the user, the \texttt{View} calls a method in the \texttt{Controller}, once again updating the graphical user interface according to user input and the data stored in the \texttt{Model}.
