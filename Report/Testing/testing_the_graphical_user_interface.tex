Quite a lot of the time making the application has actually been spend on using the application, testing the graphical user interface, trying out various different inputs in the search fields, navigating the map in different ways, all while trying to find times and places, where the system would not perform as it was meant to. And many times, we have been successful in our search, causing the revealing of an issue not known at the given time, and then again giving us the opportunity to correct the issue or at least to beware of it.

Not only has this kind of testing been the basis of the rest of the tests, giving us an idea of areas to tests which we had not previously realized, but it also causes us to now be more secure about the overall stability of the application.

This kind of testing is not documented anywhere, nor can it be used to prove that the application is without issues (which it is not). But it can give us an idea that the application is stable in a vast amount of cases of general usage.
