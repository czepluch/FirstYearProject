As with the \texttt{Coordinates}, \texttt{GVertex}, and \texttt{Vertex} class, the \texttt{TripEdge} class is tested in a blackbox test of inputs values representing most, if not all, possible inputs, and we do believe in the stability of the method. The expectancy can be found in section \ref{sec:TripEdge class} on page \pageref{sec:TripEdge class}. All test are passed.
