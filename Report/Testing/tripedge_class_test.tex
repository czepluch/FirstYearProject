As with the \texttt{Coordinates} and \texttt{Vertex} classes, the \texttt{TripEdge} class is tested in a blackbox test of inputs values representing most, if not all, possible inputs, and we do believe in the stability of the method. The expectancy table can be found in section \ref{sec:TripEdge class} on page \pageref{sec:TripEdge class}. All test are passed.
