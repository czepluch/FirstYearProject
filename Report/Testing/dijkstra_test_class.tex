The purpose of this test is to test whether our path finding algorithm (in the \texttt{Dijkstra} class) finds the correct fastest and shortest paths between two points in a graph. The test uses two test graphs small enough for us to see what the actual output of the algorithm should be, making it easy to compare actual output with expected output. That being said, the graphs are large enough for us to produce several test-cases in which the fastest and shortest paths between two points are not the same. The expectancy table and an illustration of the test can be found in section \ref{sec:Dijkstra class} on page \pageref{sec:Dijkstra class}

Based on the test, we can not be certain that no special cases exists where the class does not produce the expected result. But the test along with us having spend quite some time searching for and evaluating different trips, give us a good indication of the stability of the class.
