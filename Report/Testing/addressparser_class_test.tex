In the \texttt{AddressParser} class, the \texttt{parseAddress} method has been tested. The method has been tested using two different tests; a whitebox test, testing all the possible conditional outcomes of the method, and a blackbox test, testing different addresses of different types, testing the stability of the method.

The two different tests share some of the same input data sets. The input data sets of both tests can be seen in the shared expectancy table in the appendix, section \ref{sec:AddressParser test appendix} on page \pageref{sec:AddressParser test appendix}.
