\subsection{QuadTree test class}
The purpose of this test is to test whether \texttt{QuadTree} is correctly built. This is done by inserting a number of edges and nodes into a \texttt{QuadTree} and checking whether the \texttt{query2D()} method (which performs a range search in a given two-dimensional interval) finds the correct edges. The input data set is small enough to give a good overview of what each query should produce, but still large enough to allow a certain diversity in the test cases. If the data set was very small, several tests might yield the same results, making it difficult to tell if this is simply by accident or if the query actually produced the right outcome.
