It is highly important for the \texttt{Coordinates} class, being central in the process of displaying everything to the user, to be produce the correct results in all cases. Two methods of the class has been tested; the \texttt{convertXToPixels} and \texttt{convertYToPixels} methods, each tested in a blackbox test.

In order to test the methods, which makes use of some values from the \texttt{MinAndMaxValues} class, these are first initialised. Each method is then tested  using ordinary input, input equal to the initialised values, and input higher and lower than the initialised values accordingly. All tests are passed.

We believe other possible input are represented by the tested inputs and that the methods therefore are stable. In addition to that, as with the \texttt{parseAddress} method of the \texttt{AddressParser} class in section \ref{sec:Testing} on page \pageref{sec:Testing}, the methods of the \texttt{Coordinates} class are also tested while testing the general user interface, since how the roads are drawn are very much dependant upon these very method. And the roads being drawn as they are supposed to (we think, though it is hard to prove) is also an indicator of the correctness of these methods.
