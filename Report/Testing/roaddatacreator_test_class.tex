The purpose of this test is to test whether our \texttt{RoadDataCreator} class writes the correct data to the \texttt{data.roads} file. The input data used in the test class are small samples (four nodes and four edges, to be precise) taken from the two files actually used by the \texttt{RoadDataCreator} class (the files from Krak) and then put into two test files, \texttt{kdv\_test\_unload.txt} and \texttt{kdv\_test\_node\_unload.txt}. Data is then written to the \texttt{kdv\_test\_out.txt} file so we can compare the contents of this file with the expected output of the \texttt{RoadDataCreator} class, one line at a time. All tests are passed.

The edge data used in the test has its associated nodes changed since we only have four nodes at our disposal, and it was easier to simply change the associated nodes of four arbitrarily chosen edges than it was to search through the entire text file from Krak to look for the right edges. The fact that this change might yield data that would not be useful in the application does not matter in this particular test.
