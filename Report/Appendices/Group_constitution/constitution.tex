\underline{Organization} (e.g. joint, distributed, other?) \\
We aim towards a mixture of the three. Working in plenum when neccessary, but retaining the possibility to distribute work when we see it fit. \\ \\
\underline{Work} (e.g. when, how much, sprinting/jogging?) \\
Meetings scheduled for monday.
Extra meetings will be planned ad-hoc \\ \\
\underline{Being together} (e.g. disagreement resolution, \ldots) \\
We will solve problems by dispute. Only when agreement is not an option will decissions be made by vote.

If agreement cannot be reached, even by vote, we will seek counsel from our teacher or TA. \\ \\
\underline{Managing differences in ambitions, \ldots} \\
We will try to maintain the highest possible level of ambition. \\
