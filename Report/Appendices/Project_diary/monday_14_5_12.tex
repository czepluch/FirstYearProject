\subsubsection*{Agenda}

	\item Write the Conclusion
	\item Write the User manual

\subsubsection*{Reflection}
The report is very close to being finished. It has been read through, and only few subsections are missing. We strongly expect to be finish with it by Friday (also depending on Filips comments). \\ \\
We will meet with Filip on Wednesday discussing the report draft. \\ \\
We have decided not to put our focus on additional extensions but instead on making the code we already have as readable and stable as possible and making sure the report is very well made.
