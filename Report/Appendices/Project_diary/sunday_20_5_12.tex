\subsubsection*{Agenda}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Discuss comments to the report
	\item Make changes to the report
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection*{Reflection}
It's been a hard days night... The awful-meter has been almost maxed out and I've been working, like a dog. \\ \\
The report is now read through several times by several of us, and it is very close to being completely done. But we have found a little change we need to make tomorrow. The code is commented and "cleaned up". The amount of oxygen in the air in this meeting room at ITU is less than optimal. \\
And now we're leaving. \\ \\
It is very satisfying that we are almost done. Our deadline of printing everything and being ready tomorrow seems to hold.
