\subsubsection*{Reflection}
We have spend the day working on parts of the report and testing. \\ \\
The first draft of the report is soon finished (which is also needed, because we have agreed with Filip to send the draft to him later today). \\ \\
All the white- and blackbox tests we have agreed on making are finished (and passed, after some changes in the code).
We are still working on the testing of the TernaryTrie and the GUI.

We will meet in a few hours on Skype, discussing the report. (Well, look at the report if possible) \\
We will read the draft as it currently is till then.
