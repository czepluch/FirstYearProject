\subsubsection*{Agenda}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Class structure
	\item Structure of FormatConverter
	\item Who does what
	\item Implementation
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection*{Reflection}
We now have a (hopefully) working implementation of our data structure, but we are still without filtering of edges.

Our application can now draw the entire map on a custom JPanel, but still no filtering is done, and zooming causes errors.

We have spend a lot of time on technical issues with versioning and Eclipse.

\subsubsection*{Work sheets}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Go from using ArrayList<Edge> to KDTree. This requires changes in several classes \\

	\item Filtering data according to coordinates and type \\
		\textsl{Niels and Jacob}
	\item Zooming \\
		\textsl{Mikkel and Sigurt}
	\item Panning
	\item Report
\end{itemize}
We don?t expect anything to be done till next time, but we are going to take a look at the differing subjects above
