The project implementation is based on data from Krak. The data used consists of two files:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \texttt{kdv\_node\_unload.txt}
	\item \texttt{kdv\_unload.txt}
\end{itemize}
The \texttt{kdv\_node\_unload.txt} contains info about all the points of interest in Denmark (we will from now on refer to these as nodes). From the nodes file, we have used the following: The id of each node, the id referring to an edge (explained below), the x-coordinate, and the y-coordinate.

The \texttt{kdv\_unload.txt} contains info about all the road segments of Denmark (we will from now on refer to these as edges). We have used the following data from the file: The id of the first node, the id of the second node, the id of the edge, the road name, the road type (highway, primary road etc.), the (\texttt{V\_POSTNR}) zip code, and the speed.

In addition to the data from Krak, we have used a list of the Danish zip codes with corresponding city names from \href{http://www.postdanmark.dk/da/Documents/Lister/postnummerfil_excel.xls}{www.postdanmark.dk/} (\url{http://www.postdanmark.dk/da/Documents/Lister/postnummerfil_excel.xls}).
