For our overall architectural pattern, we have chosen to use the Model, View, Controller (MVC) pattern. We decided to do so to make sure that the application is modular and has an easy-to-maintain class structure. Using the MVC pattern results in separation of the different parts of our application, while providing a loose coupling between these elements. During the making of the application, this has proven very useful to us since we have been changing some classes and data structures quite a few times, while the graphical user interface has been very consistent.
