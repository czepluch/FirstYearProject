For our overall architectural pattern, we have chosen to use the Model, View, Controller (MVC) pattern. We chose to do so, to make sure that we have a very modular and easy-to-maintain class structure. Using the MVC pattern results in separation of the different aspects of our application, while still providing a loose coupling between these elements. During the making of the application it has proven very useful to us since we have been chancing our classes and data structures quite a few times.
