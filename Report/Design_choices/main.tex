In this section, we will go through our design choices. We will go through things like design patterns, data structures, and visualisation. At the same time we will explain our choices.

This section does not contain any information about the implementation of the application, which for several reasons can vary from the design choices made. Variations will be discussed in the Discussion section on page \pageref{sec:Discussion}.
